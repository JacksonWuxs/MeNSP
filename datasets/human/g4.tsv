0	Gas spreads throughout all spaces.
0	Gas in the balloon spreads everywhere.
0	Charlie's claim is that gas spreads everywhere.
1	The evidence suggests that the air in the balloon has spread throughout.
1	Charlie's claim is right because air in the ballon spreads everywhere.
1	That air in the balloon spreads everywhere supports Charlie's claim.
2	The evidence suggests that the air inside the balloon will eventually fill the entire container, just as the gas particles in the closed box will distribute themselves evenly throughout the container.
2	The balloon and box are both closed containers, and the evidence shows that the air in the balloon will spread to fill the container. Therefore, the air in the box will also spread to fill the container completely.
2	The air in the balloon and the gas particles in the box are both contained in closed containers, and the evidence indicates that gas particles in the balloon will distribute themselves evenly throughout the container. So gas in the box will distribute in the same way.
