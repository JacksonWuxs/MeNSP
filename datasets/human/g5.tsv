0	The bubbles in the soda water rise to the top.
0	Gas in the box float on the top.
0	Because gas floats on the top.
1	Sam claims that gas particles rise to the top of a box, and this is supported by the observation that bubbles in soda water also rise to the top.
1	Sam's claim is right because bubbles in soda water float to the top.
1	The evidence supports Sam's claim that gas particles float on the top.
2	Sam's claim is that gas particles in a box will float to the top, and this is supported by the evidence of bubbles in soda water, which are also gas particles, floating to the top. Therefore, Sam can infer that air in the box will also float to the top.
2	Sam has proposed that gas particles in a container will rise to the top. The observation of bubbles in soda water, which are composed of gas, rising to the surface supports this claim. Based on this evidence, it can be inferred that air in a box will also rise to the top.
2	According to Sam, gas particles will rise to the top of a container. The behavior of bubbles in soda water, which are made up of gas, supports this idea. From this, it can be concluded that air in a box will also rise to the top.
