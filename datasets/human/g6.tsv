0	The air in the balloon fills the balloon evenly.
0	Gas in the box spreads everywhere.
0	Because gas spreads everywhere.
1	Charlie concludes that gases will also spread evenly throughout a container like a box citing the way that air fills a balloon evenly as evidence.
1	Charlie's claim is right because the air in the balloon spreads everywhere.
1	The evidence supports Charlie's claim that gas particles spread everywhere in the box.
2	Charlie claims that gas particles will fill a container uniformly, and cites the example of a balloon as evidence. Since the air in a balloon spreads evenly throughout the balloon, Charlie reasons that the same should be true of a gas in a container such as a box.
2	Charlie's claim is that gas particles will evenly distribute themselves within a container. As evidence, Charlie points to the behavior of air in a balloon, which fills the balloon uniformly. Based on this, Charlie concludes that a gas in a container like a box should behave similarly, spreading evenly throughout the container.
2	Charlie believes that gases will uniformly fill the box. To support this idea, Charlie could point to the way that air fills a balloon evenly. From this, Charlie could infer that gases will also spread evenly throughout a box.
