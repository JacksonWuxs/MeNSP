Remember that Sam's claim is that the particles will look like Figure 2.1 after one minute. Then, teacher tells Sam: Gas bubbles in soda float to the top.	Explain how this evidence could be used to support Sam's claim.	Gas bubbles float to the top very fast is a evidence to support Sam claim.	Gas bubbles float on the top and gas particles also float on the top.	Gas particles do the same thing as gas bubbles do in soda. Both gas particles and gas bubbles float on the top.	Since they are light, both gas bubbles and gas particles flow on the top in soda.
